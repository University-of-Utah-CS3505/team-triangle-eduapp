Conditionals

Loops can help with simple levels,
but sometimes there are obstacles in 
the way! Using conditions, loops can
still be used to solve the level.

Using object_ahead(), which returns true if
there is an object in the way, write a
solution that uses loops and conditions.

Here is an example:

for r in range(5):
    if object_ahead():
        shoot()
    forward()
