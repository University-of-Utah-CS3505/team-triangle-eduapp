#Welcome to Snake Tanks!!!
#Here, you will learn basic coding concepts
# by using Python 
#to manuever your tank across the map.
#In this first level, you will learn 
#sequential statements.
#Sequential statements, are bits of code
# that are interpreted one after another,
#in the order in which they are written
#Use the following sequential statements 
#(commands) to move the tank and complete level 1.
#Move Forward: forward()
#Turn Left, right: turn_left(), turn_right()
#shoot: shoot()
#the first 3 commands are done for you
#Press F5 to run your code
